## About

I am an Application Security Specialist and DevSecOps Engineer with 5+ years of experience integrating security into software development lifecycles without compromising agility. I deliver security controls throughout SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, reducing risk through automation, secure design, and proactive threat mitigation.

I work cross-functionally with development, architecture, infrastructure, and product teams to embed security in an automated, scalable manner aligned with business goals. My approach focuses on risk-based governance, enabling security as an accelerator rather than a blocker.

I have led and implemented Application Security & DevSecOps strategies across finance, aviation, telecommunications, and healthcare sectors, translating security requirements into practical solutions that strengthen the delivery of resilient, scalable, and reliable products.

*Segurança como acelerador, não como obstáculo.*
