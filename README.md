## About Me:

I am an application security specialist and DevSecOps engineer with over 5 years of experience integrating security into software development lifecycles without compromising agility. I provide security controls across the SDLC and CI/CD pipelines, reducing risk through automation, secure design, and proactive threat mitigation.

I work directly with development, architecture, infrastructure, and product teams to embed security directly into the SDLC and CI/CD through automation and protections aligned with business objectives. My approach focuses on risk-based decisions, creating controls that reduce exposure upfront and help teams deliver faster, enabling security to be an accelerator rather than a blocker.

I have led and implemented application security and DevSecOps strategies in the financial, aviation, telecommunications, and healthcare industries, translating security requirements into practical solutions that strengthen the delivery of resilient, scalable, and reliable products.

## *My motto is: Security as an accelerator and business partner, not a blocker/impediment.*

## 🏆 Achievements

### Impact Highlights

- Built hands-on CI/CD security gates with risk-based enforcement (severity, context, and release criticality), accelerating remediation and preventing high-risk issues from reaching production.

- Standardized end-to-end vulnerability triage and reporting with automated dashboards, improving visibility, ownership, and SLA-driven execution across squads.

- Implemented high-coverage security automation in pipelines (SAST/SCA/DAST and secrets detection), reducing manual effort and creating a repeatable secure delivery path.

- Reduced fraud and data leakage exposure through practical threat modeling and targeted secure code reviews focused on critical flows, APIs, and sensitive data paths.

- Established structured Security Champions and Security by Design programs, enabling engineering teams with playbooks, guardrails, and scalable security enablement.

- Led security strategy and governance aligned with OWASP SAMM, OWASP ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001, translating frameworks into actionable engineering controls.

- Reduced rework and delivery friction by integrating security early in the SDLC with clear standards, automation, and risk-based prioritization.

- Shifted security from a gatekeeping function to a strategic product and technology partner by embedding security into engineering workflows and decision-making.

- Automated the vulnerability management lifecycle (identify → triage → prioritize → remediate → verify → report), improving consistency, traceability, and operational maturity.

## AppSec Express

I created AppSec Express to make high-quality application security and DevSecOps accessible without slowing down delivery. On my website, I offer practical, engineering-focused services that help teams reduce risk and deliver with confidence by enabling secure SDLC, CI/CD security controls, threat modeling, secure code review, and vulnerability management that truly fit into real workflows. 

*My goal is simple: to transform security into a delivery accelerator with clear priorities, measurable results, and a path for teams to evolve and scale.*

## Security Suite

I started Security Suite because most teams still struggle with fragmented tools, confusing findings, and inconsistent remediation workflows. Security Suite is designed to unify the vulnerability lifecycle from end to end: ingesting and normalizing scanner findings, deduplicating, applying consistent severity and status, and producing audit-ready reports. 

*What sets it apart is its focus on standardization and operational clarity, so teams can move from “more scans” to real risk reduction, faster triage, and verified fixes with traceability.*
